Decentralized News Network
News by the People, for the People
A decentralized news network backed by incentives for individuals to create, review, and consume news.
DNN a network in which writers produce political content that is reviewed by fact-checkers before being published on the network without the risk of being taken down. All parties involved in publishing a factual article will be rewarded with DNN tokens in a self-sustaining environment that thrives on tangible activity and accuracy of content rather than on advertising revenue and corporate interests.

There is lots of problem with THE CURRENT STATE OF NEWS. So a decentralized network can fix them.
DNN is comprised of four types of actors that each have key roles and contributions that together, make up the underlying functions and framework of the network:
1- Writers, or reporters, are individuals who submit political content in the form of articles. Whether freelance journalist, casual blogger, or an average consumer of global news, anyone can contribute to the DNN.
2-Reviewers, or editors, read and vote upon submitted articles before an article is available for public consumption on the DNNâ€™s article feed. The review process includes basic tasks such as noting grammatical errors, pointing out inaccuracies and questionable statements, as well as content classification.
3- Readers are news consumers. Readers can comment, add notes, share, tip, bookmark articles of interest, and denote articles they deem questionable. Unlike readers on traditional news platforms, readers on DNN play an active role in helping to shape the news they read, which includes participating in Reader Suggestions whereby article topics are put forward by you, the news consumer. Readers pay for access in DNN tokens.
4- publishers that unlike readers, reviewers, and writers who are human actors of the network, publishers are server nodes which act as a proxy between human contributors and the DNN network residing on the Ethereum blockchain.
DNN TOKEN: The DNN token is the primary instrument of value that can be earned or used to carry out actions on the platform. To enable the ability to price actions (such as reader tips to writers or reader subscriptions) on a micro scale, the DNN token will be divisible by up to 3 decimal places. DNN tokens can be obtained in the following way: Earn it by contributing to the network.
